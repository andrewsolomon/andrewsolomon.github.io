# How to influence Google search results

If you want better search results, you need to tell Google how to populate its search index! How do you do that? Put the search term in question on a web page, and link it to the target page.

For example, I'd like the search term "access file with perl" to get me the associated link https://metacpan.org/pod/Path::Tiny. A link like this:

[access file with perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/Path::Tiny)

means that when Google crawls this page, it will add my vote to improve the ranking of my favoured link to the search term.

*Okay, how do I cast my vote?*

That's the easy bit - and it's free!
* Create an account at [Github](https://github.com/).
* [Create](https://pages.github.com/) a simple [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) web page.
* Whenever you find a search term for which Google should get a better link, add it to your page.
* Whenever you see a page which has a good mapping of links from the search terms, link to it!

Here's the [source code](https://github.com/andrewsolomon/andrewsolomon.github.io/blame/main/influence-google-search-results.md) - with markdown it's really easy.

Of course, not all votes are equal. Google's indexer will give more weight to my links if you link to this page. If you think this page is helpful, please link to it like this:
```

```
and [tell the world through Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20to%20influence%20Google%20search%20results%20https%3A%2F%2Fandrewsolomon.github.io%2Finfluence-google-search-results.html)!
